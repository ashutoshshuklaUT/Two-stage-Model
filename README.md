# Transmission Grid Resilience Planning Under Flood Uncertainty

Stochastic and robust optimization models for transmission grid hardening decisions to minimize flood-related power outages from hurricanes.

## Overview

This code implements optimization models that integrate flood predictions with power flow analysis to recommend optimal substation hardening strategies under hurricane flood uncertainty.

## Key Features

- Stochastic and robust optimization frameworks
- Couples geoscience-based flood models with DC/AC power flow
- Captures correlated flooding across substations
- Determines optimal hardening budgets
- Sensitivity analysis for key parameters
